  This is a tutorial on how to write a simple ai that reads mnist data. the accuracy is around 99% after 10 epochs. 
  This program uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to improve learning ability. 
  Cross entropy loss was used, as well as torch.optim optimizer. 

  This is ment to be done on visual studio code. 

  Downloading the libraries is required, if they are not already. 

  type:
  pip3 install torch torchvision

  the mnist files are attatched.
