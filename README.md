  This is a tutorial on how to write a simple ai that reads mnist data. the accuracy is around 99% after 10 epochs. 
  This program uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to improve learning ability. 
  Cross entropy loss was used, as well as torch.optim optimizer. 

  This is ment to be done on visual studio code. 

  Downloading the libraries is required, if they are not already. 

  type:
  pip3 install torch torchvision

go to this link, download the files as a zip and unzip. if you just unzip into your downloads folder, the input path in mnist loader should work, just put your name in user.
